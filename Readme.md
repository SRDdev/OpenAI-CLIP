# OpenAI CLIP : Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training 

This repository is an educational attempt on understanding and replicating OpenAI CLIP 2021 model in PyTorch.



Note : OpenAI has open-sourced some of the code relating to CLIP model but it is complicaetd to understand , 
I rather prefer to implement it from paper. I also came across a good tutorial inspired by CLIP model on Keras code examples and which helped me in replicating the code in PyTorch.
